    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making Peanut Butter Balls couldn't be simpler.
       The filling ingredients (creamy peanut butter, butter, vanilla extract,
       and confectioners (powdered or icing) sugar) are just mixed together, 
       rolled into small balls, chilled, and then dipped in melted chocolate. 
       A few notes on making this no bake confection.
